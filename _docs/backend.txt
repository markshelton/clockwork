*/ Functions /*

- Display Calendar (View)
- Enter Task (Form)
  a. Autocomplete Start Time, End Time & Duration
  b. If (Fixed Location?): 
    i. Google Maps Request
    ii. Confirm with User
- Enter User Preferences (Form)
- Place Task (Process)
  a. Check for errors - invalid location / time, overlap
  b. If (Fixed Time?): Place Task(New Task)
  c. Else: 
    i. Generate Paths:
      for Placed Task in Placed Tasks:
        if (not New Task.Fixed Location?):
          GMaps Request: New Task.Location near Placed Task.Location

*/ Macro Rules /*

1. Place all fixed tasks
2. Minimize path time

*/ Micro Rules /*

1. Path type priority is Walk, Public Transport, Drive
